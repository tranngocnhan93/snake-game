# Snake Game Project

A game inspired by Nokia's snake game where the player collect food to grow up, break walls to the door leading
to the next level. The main idea of this game is "escape sequence" which enables us to move the cursor of the command line to different positions to build graphical objects (walls, food, door, etc.). To play the game, please refer to the instruction in the report
